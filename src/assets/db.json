Right now, there are some 270,000 tons of trash swirling around the world's oceans in giant, tangled heaps. Ocean waves break these plastics down into smaller and smaller pieces, endangering the surrounding marine life as fish and birds either digest the plastic debris, mistaking it for food, or become entangled in it. Some of the plastic toxins they digest even make it up the food chain into the fish many of us eat. That’s right—we’re eating the plastic trash, too. One study found that one-quarter of all fish sold in California markets had microplastics and fibers in their guts.</p><p>Ocean 'smog' created from the disposable plastics we all throw away has become a huge concern.
