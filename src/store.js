        We’ve all heard that sitting is bad for you. It’s the reason why many of your co-workers are getting standing desks, and why sitting for long periods of time may actually leave you feeling more tired than when you first sat down (If you’ve ever crossed an ocean in an airplane, you know the feeling well.).

        Why does sitting wear on us so much? And what can we do to support our backs—and our health—while we’re at work, where many of us sit for 7+ hours a day, five days a week? Turns out, there are simple changes you can make to your daily routine to minimize the negative health effects of sitting, and show your body some workplace respect.

        According to the <a href="https://news.heart.org/sitting-too-much-may-raise-heart-disease-risk/" target="_none">American Heart Association</a>, even people who exercise regularly aren’t immune to the dangers of sitting. Sedentary time—which includes working at a computer, driving, watching TV, reading, and sitting down for meals—increases your risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Yet the average American adult with a desk job spends <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/02/medical-researchers-have-figured-out-how-much-time-is-okay-to-spend-sitting-each-day/?utm_term=.4aee41d215ef" target="_none">eight to ten hours a day sitting</a>. This seemingly benign activity is not only bad for your heart and blood vessels, it’s also bad for your musculoskeletal system, and your ability to maintain a healthy weight. Why is this the case? Let’s look at what happens physically in your body when you sit for more than 30 minutes at a stretch.
      </p>

      <h2>What Happens When You Sit</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Your glutes lengthen and hamstrings shorten.</b> When you sit, two main things are happening at the hip joint: Your hamstrings are in a shortened position, and the more you sit, the tighter your hamstrings get. Tight hammies are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27040059" target="_none">the number one cause of low back pain!</a> Second, when sitting, your gluteal muscles are lengthened to their full range of motion. Being in a lengthened position for long periods of time makes those butt muscles weak.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s the big deal about glute muscles? They aid in balance, gait, and hip stability. With weak glute muscles comes valgus knees (knees that cave in when bending), which can cause a cascade of negative effects on your gait, lower body strength, and <a href="http://nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Joint_&_Bone_Health/1232" target="_none">joint health</a>. Weak glutes can also lead to a general lack of stability and balance, which increases your risk of falling. Plus, glutes (with the help of our quadriceps), are responsible for stepping up and decelerating yourself down steps. Think stairs, hiking, walking uphill, etc. A very important movement!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Your body pulls forward.</b> When you sit down and reach out to something in front of you (i.e., keyboard, mouse, book, coffee mug), your shoulders protract forward, taking the whole upper body with them and rounding out your upper back.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Neck muscles get overstressed.</b> The action above usually leads you to tilt your head forward, taking the weight of your head away from the supportive framework of your shoulders and spine. So your neck muscles start working overtime to keep your head from falling off your shoulders. Picture a rope attached to a tall building and you are leaning back, pulling on this rope to keep this building from falling over. Now do this for hours. That’s what your neck muscles are doing while your head is tilted forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shoulders and back muscles work overtime.</b> Your upper back muscles are in a constant state of lengthening as you are working, reaching and looking forward in your seated position. This makes them very weak! In addition, your muscles surrounding your shoulder blades are constantly “on,” working to stabilize your shoulders and arms as you work at your computer. Constantly stabilizing and holding your arms out in front of you fatigues those upper back muscles and can lead to aches and pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Core muscles become weak.</b> When we sit with bad posture the spine is tiling forward and the abdominal muscles are de-activated. Sitting requires little effort from the majority of abdominal muscles; the act of sitting leaves them lax and underused.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Circulation decreases.</b> When you minimize your movement, especially with a sitting position, your blood circulation decreases which causes blood to pool in the legs. This can lead to swollen ankles, varicose veins, and even blood clots in the legs. Slowing circulation also means less blood to the brain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Productivity and alertness decline.</b> When blood flow, which carries much-needed oxygen to the brain, is restricted, your thoughts can become foggy, you’ll feel sluggish, and you can be more easily distracted. If you get up, move for a few minutes and stretch, most likely you’ll return to your desk with a new perspective, new ideas, and a fresh start to your work!
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Likelihood of weight gain increases.</b> Lastly, sitting all day decreases the number of calories you burn and therefore is a big factor in weight gain. There are many associations with sitting and weight gain, obesity, and risk of disease. To make this idea more tangible, picture this: If you stand instead of sit, you’ll burn between 30-50 extra calories per hour depending on your size. That might not sound significant, but in an 8-hour work day that is an extra 240-400 calories burned! In a week that’s 1,200-2,000 extra calories being used for standing! It takes a 3,500 calorie deficit to lose a pound of fat. So in just a few weeks you can lose a pound of fat simply from standing. Imagine the progress you’d see after a year!
      </p>

      <p>
        All this being said, we still have to work, right? So, what can you do to help your body? The best thing you can do is use a standing desk as much as possible. Your body will thank you so much for getting out of that sitting position. But if you can’t stand while you work (and even if you can) try to incorporate these basics into your day:
      </p>



      <p><b>1. Get up and stretch.</b> Walk from meeting to meeting, get up and get a water or snack, and get a few twists and stretches in every 20-30 mins at your desk. Remember to stretch out your hamstrings in particular. As I mentioned, tight hamstrings are the number one cause of low back pain in the workplace. Try yoga, or better yet, just spend 10 minutes a day stretching those hammies out.</p>
      <p><b>2. Strengthen your upper back.</b> Any sort of upper body pulling motion will do wonders on your back. TRX rows, planking rows, pull ups, spri band pulls… anything where your arms are out in front of you (or overhead) and you are pulling back or down towards the armpits is perfect!</p>
      <p><b>3. Increase your daily activity.</b> Schedule walking meetings and phone calls, take the stairs rather than the elevator, exercise at lunch, or try biking to work. Set alarms on your phone to remind yourself to get up and stretch. Get up and go ask people questions in person rather than sending an email. At the very least, start becoming more aware of how much time you actually spend sitting each day.</p>
      <p><b>4. Avoid sitting outside work.</b> Once you’re home for the day, get some exercise! Go for a walk with your family, play with the kids, stand up and cook an awesome meal in the kitchen, or substitute hobbies for TV time. Just try and be active—your body will thank you!</p>

        contentPreview: `Childhood is when good nutrition really counts. Yet many kids don’t receive enough of the nutrients they need for healthy development. Get the 411 on our newest products, all made with kids’ healthy development—and parents’ top nutritional concerns—in mind.`,

        <p>
        Kids’ health gets a lot of media attention during back-to-school season—ads, discounts, blog posts! But for most parents, thinking about their child’s health isn’t a seasonal thing. We think about our kids pretty much every day—what they eat, whether they’re getting the nutrients they need, how we can support their ongoing physical and mental development.
      </p>

      <p>
        All this obsessing over what our kids eat, and more importantly what they don’t eat, isn’t groundless. Research shows us time and again that <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11899/chapter/4#40" target="_none">childhood is when good nutrition really counts</a>, yet most kids—whether because they’re picky about the foods they eat, or because the most nutritious foods aren’t always available to them—simply don’t get the nutrition they need for healthy development through their teen years.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know, for example, that omega-3 DHA, an essential nutrient that can only be obtained from diet, is critical for healthy brain development.* We also know that the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm536514.htm" target="_none">FDA recommends</a> that pregnant and lactating women, along with children ages 2 and up, eat between 1-3 servings of fish every week. But less than 10% of people across all age groups consume adequate amounts of fish on a regular basis, according to the <a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf" target="_none">USDA’s 2015 Scientific Report on Dietary Guidelines.</a>

      <p>
        The deficit in omega-3 consumption is a big reason why Nordic Naturals is introducing <a href="http://nordicnaturals.com/children/" target="_none">five new children’s products</a>. (We're also introducing a new look with easier-to-read labels for some of our other children’s product favorites).
      </p>

      <p>
        We want to make sure that every parent has access to high-quality, research-supported, and age-appropriate nutritional supplements to meet their child’s individual nutritional needs. And, we want to make sure that kids actually enjoy taking the supplements their parents give them. I know from my own experiments with getting my three-year-old to take fish oil daily that taste—and delivery format—really, truly matters.

      </p>

      <p>
        In short, we’re on a mission to educate parents all over the world that every child needs omega-3s as part of a healthy foundation. So with that said, here’s a look at the new Nordic Naturals children’s products, available in stores and online this month:

      </p>
      <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1505424524/web/new-products-two-bottles.jpg">
      <p>
        <h2>1) Children’s DHA™ Xtra (<a href="https://nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1783" target="_none">liquid</a> and <a href="https://nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1784" target="_noen">soft gels</a>)</h2>
      </p>

      <p>
        With so few kids getting adequate amounts of omega-3s from their food, we thought it was important to offer a formula that increases support for this critical nutrient. Found in high concentrations in our brains and eyes, omega-3 DHA is a key nutrient for healthy cognitive and nervous system development.* Both omega-3 EPA and DHA are found in virtually all our cell membranes, making them equally important for overall health.* Children’s DHA Xtra effectively doubles the amounts of DHA in our popular <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1442" target="_none">Children’s DHA™</a> product, giving kids ages 1 to 6 even greater support for healthy development.*

      </p>

      <p>
        Our liquid formula is recommended for ages 1-3, while our soft gels are recommended for ages 3-6. Both have a new, natural berry punch flavor.

      <h2>2) <a href="https://nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1786" target="_none">Omega Focus Junior</a></h2>

      <p>
        Helping children focus and stay on task academically is a concern for just about every parent today. We decided it was time to lend kids (and parents) some nutritional support on this front. Our new Omega Focus Junior blends concentrated, DHA-rich fish oil with phosphatidylcholine (sourced from herring roe, not soy), L-carnosine, magnesium, and zinc. In combination, these nutrients help support attention, focus, calm, and learning in children ages 6-18.*

      </p>

      <p>
        Something I learned in talking to our product development team about this one-of-a-kind product: the magnesium and zinc in this formula are chelated glycinates, meaning they are are attached to glycine, an amino acid, to help make the minerals easy to absorb.

      <h2>3) <a href="https://nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1785" target="_none">Ultimate Omega® 2X Teen</a></h2>
      <p>
        Just because your child reaches adolescence doesn’t mean his or her brain has stopped growing. In fact, your child’s brain will likely continue to grow well into his or her early 20s. This means that omega-3s EPA and DHA still play critical roles in your teen’s healthy cognitive development.* The problem is, teens are busy people prone to skipping meals and snacking on whatever’s at hand rather than seeking out nutritious fare. Our new Ultimate Omega 2X Teen gives teens a way to get those all-important omega-3s without too much effort (or excuses). Each strawberry-flavored, mini-sized soft gel packs a teen-sized serving of our highest concentration fish oil.

      <p>
        <h2>4) <a href="https://nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1787" target="_none">Kids Nordic Flora Probiotic Pixies</a></h2>
      </p>

      <p>
        Probiotics seem to be everywhere these days, and for good reason. Research is continually linking digestive health to immune health and overall wellness.* Given the frequency with which my child typically gets sick in the winter, this new probiotic formula definitely caught my attention. It’s a healthy twist on the pixie sticks you probably remember from your own childhood—a delicious powder that melts on your tongue. Only this powder is actually nutritious, as well as being fun to eat. Our new Kids Nordic Flora Probiotic Pixies contains 3 billion CFU of two powerful, research-backed probiotic strains shown to support kids’ immune and respiratory health.* If that means fewer seasonal bugs at our house, then I’m already a fan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like all our probiotic formulas, this one is shelf stable (meaning it doesn’t need refrigeration), with strains that are proven to survive passage through the harsh environment of the digestive tract. And, like every product we make at Nordic Naturals, it’s also non-GMO and third-party tested for potency and purity.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/children" target="_none">five new products</a> (counting DHA Xtra twice, since it comes in both liquid and soft gels) will start to be available beginning this week. Go check them out!

        contentPreview: 'There’s a lot going on beneath the surface of our skin. Here’s what you can do—beyond applying lotions and sunscreens—to nourish and care for this critical organ.',
        content: `
        <p>
          Skin is your body's largest organ, accounting for as much as <a href="https://www.livescience.com/32939-how-much-does-skin-weigh.html" target="_none">16% of your body weight</a>. Inch by inch, your skin adds up to an impressive 22 square feet. What you might not realize about this hard-working organ is that it is also constantly renewing itself—at a rate of about 30,000-40,000 cells per minute. And it does this for decades.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than just a flexible covering for our muscles, organs, and bones, our skin shields us from harmful bacteria and alerts our immune system when bacteria breaches that shield. Our skin helps keep us warm, signals our bodies to sweat when we get overheated, and is responsible for our keen sense of touch.
        </p>

        <p>
          What can you do to take care of your skin, beyond moisturizing and protecting it with sunscreens and lotions? As it turns out, there are some important ways to take care of your skin from the inside. Understanding how your skin works is the first step in knowing how to give it the nourishment it needs.

        </p>
        <h2>How Your Skin Works</h2>
        <p>
          Skin is composed of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outer layer of skin that you can see and feel—it serves as your body’s first barrier of protection from harmful bacteria, viruses, and pollutants. Your epidermis contains specialized immune cells that identify harmful microbes and prevent them from entering your body. The epidermis also contains melanin, the pigmentation that gives skin its color, and helps prevent the absorption of UV rays.
        </p>
        <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1504219143/web/blog-assets/skin-anatomy-2.jpg">
        <p>
          The much thicker dermis is the inner layer of skin, just beneath the epidermis. Made up of collagen, elastin, and fibrillin (a component of connective tissue), the dermis provides nutritional and structural support for the epidermis. It is where the blood vessels, hair follicles, oil glands, and sweat glands in our skin are located.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dermis helps regulate your body temperature, and contains the sensitive nerve endings that allow you to interpret and interact with the world around you. It’s here, in the dermis, that new cells are constantly produced to replace old cells in the epidermis as they are sloughed off at the surface. The hard-to-reach dermis is where nourishment from the inside really matters.
        </p>
          <h2>Feeding Your Skin</h2>
        <p>
          Eating a balanced, nutrient-rich diet, getting a good night’s sleep, and managing your stress levels are all important lifestyle habits for taking care of your skin, and your body in general. But there are several nutrients known to play a big part in skin health—here are just a few your skin will thank you for:
        </p>
          <h2>Water</h2>
        <p>
          Your skin is made up of cells, and your cells are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9879/" target="_none">made up of approximately 70% water</a>. Adequate water intake helps maintain your body’s homeostasis, and helps your body remove and excrete metabolic wastes. Without adequate water intake, your skin can’t function at its best. How much is enough?  The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences sets <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx" target="_none">general recommendations</a> of 91 ounces of total water each day—from all beverages and foods—for women, and 125 ounces of total water each day for men.
        </p>
          <h2>Probiotics</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past decade, scientists and researchers have made great progress in understanding <a href="http://nordicnaturals.com/blog/all-about-science/fermented-foods-and-probiotics-your-ticket-to-a-healthy-microbiome/" target="_none">the role of probiotics</a> in human health. Many of us know that probiotics are good for our gut, but research increasingly shows that the health benefits of probiotics can extend far beyond the gut to other parts of our bodies. Recent studies suggest that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583611" target="_none">probiotics in the gut have the potential to influence the health of the skin</a>, and that probiotics have the capacity to optimize, maintain, and restore the microbiota of the skin in a variety of different ways.*
        </p>
          <h2>Essential Fats EPA, DHA, & GLA</h2>
        <p>
          Omega-3s EPA and DHA, along with omega-6 GLA, are essential fats that play such an important role in skin health that <a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/skin-health/essential-fatty-acids" target="_none">deficiency in these nutrients is often first visible in the skin.</a>* That’s because our skin can synthesize some fatty acids, such as saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, but can’t synthesize the long-chain essential fatty acids EPA, DHA, and GLA. We must get these essential fats from foods or supplements.

        </p>

        <p>
          EPA, DHA, and GLA are found in the cell membranes that surround skin cells—really, all the body’s cells—where they help carry important nutrients into our cells, and carry waste out.* These essential fats also help our skin retain its moisture, and evenly distribute melanin that protects against age-related free radical and oxidative damage. And, they assist in healthy skin cell turnover.*

        </p>

        <p>
          Supplementing with <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Omega-3,6,9_combinations/363" target="_none">EPA and DHA from fish oil and GLA from borage oil</a> can benefit all skin types and help support healthy skin function.* These fats are best taken together, since the benefits of GLA increase when it is taken with EPA and DHA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keeping your skin healthy on the inside goes a long way toward staying healthy overall. And that’s a beautiful thing.

        <p>
          After a long summer, there’s nothing quite like heading back to school. The anticipation. The shopping. That secret guilt you feel because junior is <i>finally</i> off your hands again. It’s okay. We’ve all been there.

        </p>

        <p>
          Kidding aside, with all that the new school year brings, it’s important not to overlook your child’s health. If there’s any time that kids are susceptible to stress, this is it.  Changes in environment, playmates, and daily routines add fresh challenges to young immune and nervous systems.

        </p>

        <p>
          One way to support your kids as they head off to learn is to make sure they’re getting adequate amounts of nutrients like omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids are critical to help each of us keep up good health, and they can have a significant impact on children’s success with both social and academic tasks.*
        </p>

        <p>
          A bit of background: Omega-3s are called “essential” fatty acids because they are needed for optimal health but our bodies can’t make them.* The only way to get enough is through diet. Ideally, this means routine consumption of omega-rich foods like cold-water fish, and taking a <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Children's_Omegas/473" target="none">daily fish oil</a> (or algae oil) supplement.

        </p>
        <h2>Omega-3s for childhood development </h2>
        <p>
          Childhood is a period of rapid growth, especially brain growth. From birth to age two kids’ brains double in size. Spurts of development also occur around ages 7, 8, and 9, and then again during mid-adolescence. And when it comes to brain health, science has pointed for a while now in a pretty clear direction toward the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738999/" target="_none">benefits of omega-3s across childhood</a>.* These nutrients—particularly the major omega-3 fats EPA and DHA—are important to both the brain’s structure (DHA is a major component of the cerebral cortex) and its function (DHA and EPA are linked to mood and cognition).* Young eyes and developing nervous systems are also big beneficiaries of these essential fats.*

        </p>

        <p>
          Recent research has focused on omega-3 status and children’s concentration, reading ability, behavior, intellectual development, and general academic performance. It’s probably safe to say that omega-3s influence kids’ ability to think and learn from conception right through adolescence.* And on top of the potential cognitive and neurological benefits, let’s not overlook the significance of academic success to a child’s self-esteem, motivation to learn, and overall social well-being. Any one of these is an excellent reason to prioritize good nutrition throughout the school year.

        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1503357603/web/blog-assets/post-images/reading-writing-omega-body.jpg">
        </p>
        <h2>Important fats in short supply</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately (but not surprisingly) most children do not eat enough oily, cold-water fish to get optimal amounts of omega-3s. This can be due to the limited availability of fresh fish in many places, or simply because of its cost. Even for families fortunate enough to make fish a common feature at mealtime, anyone with kids knows they can be pretty picky eaters.

        </p>
        <p>
          On a societal level, the industrial food chain also puts omega-3s out of kids’ reach. The generally balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fats that people got from foods of the past has been radically changed by factory farming and industrialization, which offers us processed foods and grain-fed meats that contain huge amounts of omega-6. This matters because omegas 3 and 6 compete for limited space in cells. When omega intake is imbalanced, the fat in shortest supply loses out.

        </p>

        <p>
          All this adds up to a solid conclusion: <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/139/3/528.full" target="_none">Schoolchildren simply don’t get adequate omega-3s on a regular basis</a>.

        </p>
        <h2>Nutritional wisdom for your scholastic superstar</h2>

        <p>
          This information should help you feel a bit more confident tackling your own child’s nutrition. But don’t be too confident—kids are still opportunists. Give them the choice between sweets and salmon and it’s no contest. Children have to learn how to make good food choices, and this starts at home. Here are a few things to try:

        </p>

        <p>
          <b>1)</b>	If possible, offer cold-water fish like salmon, cod, or halibut a few times a week. Kids often have to try a food many times before it takes. Packed lunches are another opportunity to try these in fish sandwich form (e.g. salmon can stand in for tuna salad).

        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2)</b> First impressions really matter, so choose a top-quality fish oil product that tastes good to kids. I can tell you from experience, it is possible. Some kids like to bite into soft gels. Others like flavored liquids. For those who like neither, great-tasting alternatives exist in gummy and emulsion forms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3)</b> Make it a routine. Kids like consistency, and you can easily make a daily supplement part of that. If children see mom or dad taking a supplement, it’ll feel less burdensome (same goes for eating fish).

        </p>

        <p>
          Every bit of good nutrition adds up, so even if you skip fish one week, or forget the omega-3s on busy days, feel good about the times you do give your kids these added nutrients. These small steps will help them make this school year one to remember.

        </p>

          On Monday, August 21st, beginning just after 10:15 a.m. PDT, it will get dark enough that city lights will turn on, the temperature will cool slightly, and some nocturnal creatures will start to stir. It’s a total eclipse of the sun, the first anyone has seen in 99 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          This once-in-a-lifetime event will be visible within a 70-mile-wide path across the country, stretching from the Oregon coast to the beaches of South Carolina. Even those of us who are not within the path of totality (<a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2017/TSE2017.html" target="_none">check the geographic map on NASA’s website</a>) will still get an impressive show, as over 80% of the sun will be eclipsed by the moon.
        </p>

        <p>
          A total solar eclipse is one of nature’s most awe-inspiring sights, one that ancient civilizations regarded as a heavenly sign. It’s also an event that comes with a warning—don’t look directly at the sun as it is eclipsed, as this could damage your eyesight. These warnings have me thinking more about my eyes, and how we need to protect them for a lifetime.

        </p>

        <p>
          Nowadays, one of the first things we can do to maintain healthy vision is to be aware of our exposure to blue light. Blue light has become an increasingly important topic over the last several years as our collective use of digital devices has steadily increased. It’s a fact of modern living—many of us spend a good portion of our days (and nights) looking at digital screens. And that means our eyes are more exposed than ever to blue light.


        </p>



        <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1502491768/solar-eclipse-body.jpg" />

        <p>
          <h2>When Your Eyes Get the Blues</h2>
        </p>

        <p>

About 30% of sunlight is blue light—light rays spanning a spectrum of colors make up the rest. Each color along the spectrum is associated with a particular wavelength. Longer wavelengths are less energetic, while shorter wavelengths are more energetic. Blue light’s shorter wavelengths and higher energy rays scatter more easily in the atmosphere than other visible light rays, which is why the sky looks blue on clear days. It’s also why we get eyestrain when looking at computer screens that emit a lot of blue light. These shorter, more energetic wavelengths can cause a flickering effect that makes it harder to focus, which can be exhausting for the eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
Some blue light exposure is actually beneficial, as blue light plays important roles in regulating our circadian rhythms that support a healthy sleep cycle. Too much exposure too late at night, however, can have the opposite effect. Blue light is often used in light therapy to support alertness and mood.
</p>
<p>
The eye’s cornea and lens naturally block harmful UV light. But blue light passes right through these initial guardians and reaches the light-sensitive retina, where overexposure can be harmful. Sources of blue light are now everywhere, from energy-efficient bulbs and compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) that illuminate our homes to the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that illuminate our smart phones, tablets, laptops, computers, e-readers, and television screens. This increased exposure to blue light has many <a href="http://2014.thevisioncouncil.org/content/blue-light-exposure-and-digital-eye-strain/adults" target="_none">researchers concerned about the short-term and long-term effects of blue light on eye health</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>Ways to Limit Blue Light Exposure</h2>
        </p>

        <p><b>1. Use filters for screens and devices</b></p>

        <p>
        A number of products for your phone/device can help block blue light. Physical screen protectors that attach to the screen of your phone or device screen and filter out blue light are one option. Digital apps that, once installed on your phone/device, tint your screen to neutralize blue light are another option. Many of these apps also automatically adjust the light emitted by your screen according to the time of day, your geographical location, and the seasonal position of the sun.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>2. Wear computer glasses and special lenses</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Computer glasses” are available that have yellow-tinted lenses, which help block blue light from entering your eyes. Glasses with special anti-reflective lenses are a related option; they reduce glare, increase contrast, and limit blue light while using computers and other digital devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>3. Get plenty of lutein, zeaxanthin, and omega-3s</b>
      </p>
      <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1502747452/solar-eclipse-body-2.jpg">
      <p>
        Lutein and zeaxanthin are dietary carotenoids. When we consume them, they’re deposited in the retina of our eyes, where they help filter out blue light. While the typical diet provides 1-2 mg lutein, research suggests that we need 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin each day for optimal health.* Omega-3s are essential fatty acids. The omega-3 DHA is especially important for the eyes, and is more concentrated in eye tissue than in any other part of our bodies. Our bodies don’t make lutein, zeaxanthin, or omega-3s, so these eye-friendly nutrients must be consumed through diet or <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1495" target="_none">supplementation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot has changed in the world since the last coast-to-coast total solar eclipse 99 years ago. Among those changes is the kind of light our eyes are exposed to now, which is quite different than it was in previous eras. Being mindful of our exposure to blue light is one simple thing we can all do to proactively support our eye health.

          <b>What do you do at Nordic Naturals, and what do you like best about your job?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          I work with just about every department here at Nordic Naturals to make our <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/NSF_Sport_Products/1194" target="_none">NSF Certified Sport</a> product line available to professional athletes, collegiate teams, major league baseball, and elite military. I spend a lot of time building relationships with coaches and dieticians, helping them educate the people in their organizations on the science behind omega-3s and recognize nutrition as a component of performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have a lot of championship team customers, and I take a lot of pride in helping the athletes do their jobs. Because professional sports may look glamorous and entertaining, but it’s really grueling. Just to be able to offer something to help them is pretty rewarding.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Where did you grow up, and how has that place influenced you?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of college athletes get scholarships to go to school, and they come from low income areas and environments that may have been unstable. Their talent gives them opportunity that they wouldn’t have otherwise. And I can relate to that. I grew up outside of Detroit, during a time of real violence and conflict. Being an athlete helped keep me focused and disciplined, and being part of a team helped me feel safer.  I think I got my work ethic from Detroit, too, because everybody there works really hard. Detroit is also a place that teaches you resilience. You learn how to pick up, brush off, and keep going.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>What personal accomplishment are you most proud of?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          I would say raising my kids is my biggest accomplishment. I have three kids, and my oldest is now 28. He’s a Sargeant in the Marines, getting ready to deploy on his third tour in Afghanistan.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>What is something about you that few people know? Do you have a hidden talent?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a serious gardener. That’s what I do in my free time. I’ll do a hardscape and drop posts in and do shrubbery to create really big privacy screens. It’s not like I’ll just go out and plant a few flowers! I pretty much designed and built my backyard. To me it’s a living space—literally.

        We all feel the effects of time in different ways. Your joints, especially, can make you feel your age. Here’s how to handle the news that you’re not as young as you used to be—and keep on moving on.
        `,
        content: `
        <p>
  It’s an unspoken secret of middle age: Nobody admits they feel differently than they used to, though everyone does. When you can’t fool yourself any longer, you must grudgingly acknowledge body parts. You notice your back because it’s now sore after a day of yard work. You discover your knees while jogging. You didn't even know your groin had muscles, until you pulled one. You get the idea.
</p>
<p>
  So, what to do when this begins to happen? First, realize that even if you think you’re still 20, your body doesn’t. After that, you can pretty much get back to business, with a better mindset toward maintaining long-term health. Second, make sure you’re getting enough omega-3s.

</p>
<h2>Why Omega-3s for Healthy Joints</h2>
<p>
There’s a lot of evidence that omega-3 fats are great for joints, even though most people think heart health when they hear “omega-3s.”  Marine-based omega-3s (not omega-3s from flaxseed, for example) are masters at helping the body respond to inflammation, right down to the cellular level.* This is ideal for your body’s more than 300 joints, where repetitive movement introduces friction that can cause gradual wear and tear.
</p>
<p>
  As you probably know, inflammation is a protective mechanism that keeps the clusters of bones, muscles, and connective tissues insulated against further movement, and potential harm. Of course, too much inflammation can be a problem. That’s why it’s so important for your body to be able to address acute inflammation after exercising.

</p>
<h2>Bodies in Motion</h2>
<p>
Each year around this time, Nordic Naturals sponsors the <a href="http://www.seascapesportsclub.com/challenger" target="_none">Challenger Tournament</a> in Aptos, California, where spectators are treated to some serious tennis (Andy Murray was the singles champ years ago). With tennis being the talk of the town, I contacted former pro and coach Brad Weston to get his take on training and nutrition.
</p>
<div class="embedded-image left">
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788656/web/blog-assets/post-images/joint-health-body.jpg">
<p><small><i>Brad Weston, tennis coach and former pro player, working the court at Seascape Sports club, where the annual Challenger Tournament is held. </i></small></p>
</div>

<p>
“Professional athletes simply wear out their joints from thousands of repetitive movements,” Weston told me. “When they experience too much pain and inflammation it can have a devastating effect on performance.”
</p>
<p>
I asked about the rest of us. Should we really be concerned by a little tennis elbow?
</p>
<p>
  “When people feel discomfort, they start to overcompensate and put their bodies in unnatural positions,” he explained. “This greatly increases the chance of injury. From one painful area, it can create another.”

</p>
<p>
  My takeaway: Athlete or not, it’s important to keep joints working well, as even small injuries can compound into larger problems.

</p>

<h2>First-Hand Experience Meets First-Rate Research</h2>
<p>
You could say that Nordic Naturals itself is the result of one man’s passion for pain-free movement. Company’s founder and CEO Joar Opheim is a native of Norway, and a former gymnast. When he moved to the U.S. he lost access to the fresh Norwegian cod liver oil he was raised on, and quickly noticed how his daily omega-3 regimen had been benefiting his hard-working joints.* Like many of us, he only began to notice body parts when they weren’t working like they used to.
</p>
<p>
Science generally confirms Joar’s experience. The benefits of increased consumption of omega-3s are documented by numerous clinical studies. It’s worth noting that many of these studies use higher amounts than what’s found in a typical serving of fish oil. For joint health, 2,000–3,000 milligrams (2–3 grams) daily is not uncommon.* For customers, this typically means looking for products with highly concentrated amounts of EPA and DHA, the most beneficial omega-3 fats.*
</p>
<p>
  A whole lifetime of joint movement is impossible to quantify, but it’s safe to say that at some point you’ll start to notice your joints. Now is as good a time as ever to make the right moves to keep your body working well.

        People have been eating fermented foods as far back as 6,000 BC. There’s a reason for that—fermented foods naturally contain the friendly bacteria our bodies needs to thrive.* What exactly do these little bugs do for us, and why are fermented foods and probiotics so essential?

  Societies around the world have been preparing and eating fermented foods as far back as 6,000 BC. They knew that fermenting made food last longer, and helped them digest their meals. But what they didn’t know is that fermented foods naturally contain friendly bacteria our bodies need to thrive.* What started as a way to preserve food has turned out to be much, much more.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been an avid home-fermenter for almost a decade. I regularly make all kinds of ferments: flavored water kefirs, goat milk kefir, fermented vegetables, and even condiments like catsup and chutney. My son loves the lightly sweet-and-tangy water kefir soda I make with black cherry juice. He calls it “good bug drink,” and I’m thrilled that this flavorful “soda” is his drink of choice.
</p>

<p>

  I first became interested in probiotics twenty years ago after my own health issues started demanding my attention. I had practically grown up on antibiotics, so when my immune system began to go haywire, I thought perhaps the place to start supporting my immune system was in my gut.* I also knew that the very best way to support my gut was with the right kind of friendly bacteria. Probiotic foods and supplements became the single most transformative thing I’ve ever done for my body. Eventually, I became curious about their history and why they are so good for us.
</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788897/web/blog-assets/post-images/probiotic-body.jpg" /></p>
<p>
Nearly every civilization includes fermented food in their culinary heritage. Almost any food can be fermented, and some prominent examples include Korean kimchi, Indian chutney, European sauerkraut, and Middle Eastern yogurt and cheese. Asian cultures ferment soybeans, seafood, black beans, sauces, and side dishes. This natural fermentation process began as a means of food preservation, allowing people to store food for weeks, months, and sometimes years. It also removed natural toxins from foods like cassava, making them safe to consume.
</p>

<p><h2>Probiotic Powerhouses</h2></p>

<p>
The beneficial yeasts and bacteria, abundant in fermented foods, protected people against foodborne illness which was prevalent due to the lack of proper food hygiene. Prior to the invention of the microscope, people didn’t know why fermented foods seemed to be good for them. But they may have suspected that fermenting—in addition to keeping foods from spoiling—actually imparted some noticeable health benefits. In fact, the recognized link between fermented foods and vibrant health started back in ancient Rome and China. The benefits of fermented food remain of great interest in modern science as well, although the message around probiotics has changed quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
  Twenty years ago, the message was simple: Yogurt is good for you. Eat it!
</p>
<p>
  Later, the question arose: Why is yogurt so good for me?
</p>
<p>
  Today science replies: Good microbes are essential to health.*
</p>

<p>
Today, we know that eating fermented foods and supplementing with <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Probiotics/1318" target="_none">probiotics</a> are great ways to support a healthy microbiome (the abundance of friendly bacteria that lives in your digestive tract and other parts of your body). And, we have some strong scientific evidence to back up why that’s important.*
</p>

<p>
Ideally, we would get these friendly microbes with our food and drink. They would provide small, daily doses of probiotics along with prebiotics, natural fibers that promote gut health and survival of good bacteria. If we consumed a great variety of foods (including probiotic foods), they would provide a diversity of microbes.
</p>

<p>
Different species of microbes exist in different locations throughout our bodies—on our skin, in our mouths, in our urinary tracts, and in our small and large intestines, for example. A healthy diversity provides a variety of needed species as well as a vibrant microbial balance.* This is the way nature intended. Unfortunately, most of us don’t eat this way. Even a healthy modern diet rarely includes an abundance of, or a variety of, fermented foods. To make matters worse, the colonies of beneficial microbes we do have are greatly affected by everyday things like:
<ul>
  <li>Antibiotics</li>
  <li>Stress</li>
  <li>Aging</li>
  <li>Alcohol</li>
  <li>Excess caffeine</li>
  <li>Processed foods</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Fortunately, there’s plenty we can do to support our beneficial microbes and build a healthy, diverse microbiome. Science helps us dig deeper and understand why a healthy microbiome is so important.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Bacteria with Benefits</b>
</p>

<p>
  Beneficial bacteria help us by pre-digesting food that it ferments, which transforms the nutrients we get from foods into highly bioavailable (readily useful) forms.* These little powerhouses can even manufacture nutrients like B-vitamins (helpful with stress and energy production) and <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1775" target="_none">vitamin K2</a> (crucial to bone health).* They also reduce the amount of sugar in foods by consuming some of that sugar during the fermentation process. And, they help us absorb vital nutrients from the foods we eat.* But as impressive as these benefits are, the role that good bacteria play in our health is even larger. Here are just a few examples:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/" target="_none">Brain Function and Mood</a>
</p>

<p>
  Research clearly shows a connection between our gut and brain via the complex central nervous system. Not only does the brain influence the type of bacteria that thrives in our gut, but that bacteria, in turn, influences the function of the brain.* This relationship is reflected in research showing an association between dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) and mood-related behaviors.* It’s a truly mutual relationship that benefits from a strong microbial landscape in our digestive system.*
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3276397/" target="_none">Immune Health</a>
</p>

<p>
  Along with the close relationship between the brain and the gut, these bacteria also influence our immune system. Essentially, the bacteria in our gut communicate with very specialized immune cells in our gut lining.* These cells promote the production of active immune cells throughout our body.* Balance is crucial to this system because imbalance can result in an over- or under-active immune response.* Neither of these responses is ideal. We want our immune system to be well informed and functioning just right for every situation. Our microbiome plays a crucial role in that balance.*
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263193/" target="_none">Healthy Weight</a>
</p>

<p>
  A healthy microbial balance promotes other healthy states related to our weight. It helps us feel full after eating meals, promotes the production of Conjugated Linoleic Acids (CLAs are helpful in maintaining ideal fat-to-lean ratios), supports a healthy lining in our digestive tract, and contributes to healthy abdominal fat distribution.* All of these things play an essential role in our quest to maintain a healthy weight and body.
</p>

<p>
In the last few decades, it has become clear to me that probiotics and probiotic foods are truly essential components of a healthy diet. Whether we’re talking about the nutrients in our food or supplements, it’s not enough to just ingest them. To reap the benefits of any nutrient, we must properly digest and absorb it through the gut wall.
</p>

<p>
Once you realize how crucial good bacteria are to that very process, and so many others, there’s no turning back. I know I couldn’t turn back, and I hope you can’t either.

        Our medicines take on lives of their own because it’s hard to imagine we might not need them again some day. But not all medicines—or supplements—are worth saving. Here’s how to decide what makes the cut, and spark some Marie Kondo joy in your cabinet.
        `,

        <p>
If the standard for saving something is, as tidying guru <a href="http://www.konmari.com/" target="_none">Marie Kondo</a> advises, “what brings you joy,” then my medicine cabinet is an epic fail.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know about you, but I’ve got an impressive collection of outdated meds. A small sampling brings back some not-so-happy memories. I once might have pawned my wedding ring for a little sleep, courtesy of that bottle of very expired grape NyQuil. Or for a chalky dribble of Calamine Plus that momentarily saved me from the agony of poison oak. Ditto for my son’s Children’s Pain & Fever, with cough suppressant. No price would’ve been too high to soothe a sick toddler.
</p>
<p>
Our medicines take on lives of their own because it’s hard to imagine we might not need them again some day. But not all medicines are worth saving—trust me, four-year-old NyQuil is pretty nasty stuff! As for supplements, it’s also worth asking yourself which ones you really need. Truth is, most people can pare down to the essentials.
</p>
<p>
Yes, each one of us has our own nutritional needs that change with time, and that sometimes require an atypical array of nutrients. But most of us can benefit from just a handful of daily supplements: a good multivitamin, high-quality omega-3 fish oil, probiotics. And for folks who don’t get enough sun exposure—sounds crazy, I know—vitamin D.  Now, you may recall that these are all nutrients that Nordic Naturals sells, so at the risk of seeming shamelessly biased, give me a chance to explain why they’re KonMari keepers.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788654/web/blog-assets/post-images/palm-tree-min.png" />
</p>
<p>

<h2>Vitamin D</h2>
</p>
<p>
Until recently, I had no idea that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018438/" target="_none">vitamin D deficiency is a major problem throughout the world</a>. For those of us living in the Sunshine State, it’s not the first thing we think of in the morning. But many places north and south of the equator get only a fraction of the sunlight that Floridians enjoy year round. Geography, combined with poor diet, long hours working indoors, sunscreen use (still a good idea), and for many women, breastfeeding (another good idea), has meant that vitamin D deficiency has slipped under the radar in many societies. Fortunately, it’s easily solved with supplementation. For most people, <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/winter11/articles/winter11pg12.html" target="_none">400–800 IU daily does the trick</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Omega-3 fish oil</h2>
</p>
<p>
With omega-3s it’s hard to know where to begin. Omega-3s are known as essential fatty acids. They’re "good" fats. Fats considered essential for optimal health. Unfortunately, people can’t synthesize omega-3s the way they can vitamin D. So, we must obtain them through diet or supplementation. Fish and algae oils abound in the long-chain omega-3s EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which are the best ones.
</p>
<p>
It’s impossible to sum up the benefits documented in 8000+ clinical studies on omega-3s, but the shortlist includes: cardiovascular health, cognition and mood, joint mobility, immune system function, vision, brain and nervous system development, healthy pregnancy, and more.* As I’ve written elsewhere, a weekly diet of cold-water fish plus a daily serving of <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Omega-3_concentrates/361" target="_none">high-quality fish oil</a> is the way to go. Keep this supplement front and center in your medicine cabinet.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Probiotics</h2>
</p>
<p>
For a long time, probiotics were the dark horse of supplements. Kinda fringe. Questionably beneficial (It’s bacteria, after all).  But fermented foods have been around for millennia, and some of the healthiest people in the world have been eating them for that long—just ask Koreans (e.g. kimchi) and Japanese (e.g. miso, natto). Apart from the proactive benefits of fermented foods, the need for supplemental probiotics has tracked alongside our ballooning use of antibiotics, which tend to decimate all life in our digestive tracts while they treat the germs they’re prescribed for. <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Probiotics/1318" target="_none">Probiotics</a> help repopulate colonies of digestive flora that are lost to this process, and that help support not only healthy digestion but also normal immune function.*
</p>
<p>
<h2>Multivitamins</h2>
</p>
<p>
Okay, objectivity aside, one reason you should take a multivitamin is because our <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1759" target="_none">Nordic Berries</a><sup>™</sup> are so darn good. But beyond that, a good multivitamin can help fill in nutritional gaps in your diet. It’s a great nutritional catch-all for people who don’t get what they should through diet. And it’s amazing how hard it is to consistently hit the nutritional mark due to busy schedules, travel, choosiness, etc. (It’s not just kids who have food preferences, you know). Consider that guidelines recommend up to 10 servings of fresh fruits and veggies daily. A good multivitamin ensures that nothing essential falls through the cracks.
</p>
<p>
So, bottom line: Even if you live by the KonMari method of ruthlessly excising anything from your life that does not bring you joy, these handful of supplements should still make the cut. After all, what’s more joyful than staying healthy?

        <p>
  Almost every company these days is talking about sustainability—and that’s a good thing. Because just as each of us has an impact on the environment and the world around us, so does every company.  The difference is really whether we as individuals and companies care about the impact we have, and as a result, choose to do things a little differently.
</p>
<p>
  We talk a lot about sustainability here at Nordic Naturals, and how we can continue to make the very best products available while also continuing to lessen our environmental impact. So what, exactly, does that look like in action? Here are seven ways we prioritize sustainability, every day.

</p>
<p>
<h2>1. We use only non-endangered, wild-caught fish</h2>
</p>
<div class="video-container" id="vid" style="margin-bottom: -26px"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ujc3bLUwqbo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>
  Because we source so many of our products from the sea, we’ve always been concerned with protecting the health of our oceans. That’s why we select only those species that are not at risk of being overfished (Arctic cod, anchovies, and sardines), and why we use only wild-caught, as opposed to farm-raised, fish.

</p>
<p>

<h2>2. We source exclusively from certified sustainable fisheries</h2>
</p>
<center><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788654/web/blog-assets/post-images/friend-of-the-sea.jpg" /></center>
<p>
  We only work with fisheries that are certified sustainable by <a href="http://www.friendofthesea.org/" target="_none">Friend of the Sea</a>, an internationally recognized, non-profit organization whose mission is to conserve the global marine habitat. This means that all of our fish comes from waters that are certified sustainable, and all of our products are FOS-certified sustainable. And, it means all of the fisheries we work with meet the following requirements:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
<li>Fish is sourced from stocks that are not overexploited</li>
<li>Fishing practices prevent bycatch of endangered species</li>
<li>Fishing practices prevent seafloor damage and reduce ecosystem impact</li>
<li>Manufacturing reflects energy efficiencies to conserve resources and minimize
    pollution</li>
<li>Company upholds high standards for waste management and social accountability</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

<h2>3. We run our green manufacturing facility in Norway on biofuel</h2>
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788653/web/blog-assets/post-images/nordic-pharma-2.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
We built our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Norway using recycled materials, incorporating structures from an old shrimp processing plant in our original design to conserve resources and minimize our impact on the immediate environment and community. Located right on the harbor in Tromsø, our 60,000-square-foot manufacturing facility runs completely on biofuel we make ourselves using leftover fats from our fish oil processing. This recycled biofuel not only minimizes our carbon footprint, it helps power other local businesses in Tromsø as well.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<h2>4. We built our headquarters to be LEED<sup>®</sup> Gold-certified </h2>
</p>
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788656/web/blog-assets/post-images/sustainability-main.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
It’s not just our manufacturing facility in Arctic Norway that’s green—our company headquarters in Watsonville, California is, too. It earned Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED<sup>®</sup> (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System, which promotes a whole-building approach to sustainability, recognizing performance in both human and environmental health. Built in 2011, our 87,000-square-foot headquarters includes skylights, radiant heating, recycled building materials, flexible lighting controls, water purification systems, and water conservation measures that reduce our water use by nearly 50 percent.
</p>
<p>
<h2>5. We use only non-GMO verified ingredients</h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788654/web/blog-assets/post-images/product-shot.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
</p>
<p>
  We’ve always been committed to using only non-GMO ingredients, and to maintaining full transparency about how the ingredients in our products are made. We work with Eurofins, a globally recognized leader in GMO testing, to rigorously test <i>all</i> ingredients across our entire product line for the absence of GMOs. Eurofins has been a pioneer in the field of molecular biological analyses for more
than 20 years, and adheres to strict European standards to ensure the absence of GMOs.
</p>
<p>
<h2>6. All of our product containers and packaging are recyclable</h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788654/web/blog-assets/post-images/recycle-bin.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
  We bottle our liquid formulas in glass, and our soft gels in #2 plastic containers—both of which are commonly picked up by most curbside recycling programs. We also use recyclable packaging wherever possible in shipping our products. And, we recently added more box sizes in our warehouse so that we can ship our products in appropriately sized boxes with minimal packaging.
</p>
<p>
We know that this is a big area where we can improve our sustainability, so we’re looking into ways to incorporate biodegradable plastics and post-consumer waste into our bottling and shipping. We’ve also made the switch to offering more eco-friendly promotional items, like our branded lip balms packaged in cardboard, bamboo utensils, and reusable cloth sandwich bags.
</p>
<p>
<h2>7. We support organizations that do good</h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788653/web/blog-assets/post-images/nordic-group-shot.jpg" />

</p>
<p>
  As a company that makes  omega-3 fish oil, among other nutrients essential to health, we know that our presence is felt in the oceans where we source our fish, and in the communities where we make and distribute our products. We see it as our responsibility to do right by the people and the places that are part of our success, and one of the ways we do that is by supporting nonprofits that practice good environmental and social stewardship. Among the organizations we currently sponsor are <a href="https://www.5gyres.org/" target="_none">The 5 Gyres Institute</a> (a global nonprofit dedicated to keeping single-use plastics out of our oceans), <a href="http://www.bbbs.org/" target="_none">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a>, and <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org/" target="_none">The Second Harvest Food Bank</a>.
</p>
<p>
We recognize that sustainability is a journey, and that prioritizing sustainability is a choice we all make, each day. With this in mind, we do our best to make sure our daily business practices reflect our passion for health.

          The constant light of Arctic summer and the irresistible pull of longer, activity-filled days can make getting enough sleep challenging. Turns out, Norwegians can teach us a thing or two about avoiding sleepless nights here in our corner of the world.

        <p>
  Some of the best things about summer are the longer, activity-filled days. And nowhere are the days of summer longer than in Arctic Norway—a place near and dear to our hearts here at Nordic Naturals.

</p>
<p>
In fact, this time of year the sun never sets at all for many Norwegians. In Nordkapp, one of the northernmost points in Europe, the sun doesn’t set for 75 days each summer. In the endless daylight off the Lofoten Islands, you can watch the sun “set” just above the horizon before watching it start to rise in the sky again—a phenomenon known as “midnight sun.”
</p>
<p>
Even below the Arctic Circle, summer nights in Norway aren’t all that dark.  At the relatively southern latitude of Oslo, twilight is as dark as it gets from May to July. For Oslo residents—and many Norwegians—summer is the season of “white nights.” Although the sun does set below the horizon there, it never gets quite low enough to turn the sky black.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The constant light of the Arctic summer certainly inspires increased activity and energy, especially after a long, dark winter in which Norwegians don’t see the sun much, if at all. But it can also make getting sleep and adequate rest more challenging, since light is the strongest external cue that affects our bodies’ internal clocks/circadian rhythms.
</p>
<p>
This can be a health issue, as there are few things more essential to mind/body health than restorative sleep, and few things more essential to sleep than darkness. Without darkness, our sleep-inducing bodily processes simply don’t get signaled.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
So how do Norwegians manage to get enough sleep during the summer months near the Arctic Circle? What could we learn from them, even if we don’t live at the top of the world? We increasingly spend more time on gadgets, which means we get less sleep ourselves, and less darkness. Here are a few strategies we can all use to help establish and maintain healthy sleep habits, even if we don’t personally experience the midnight sun and white nights of summer in Arctic Norway.
</p>
<p>
<h2>1. Simulate night</h2>
</p>
<p>
Since darkness doesn’t naturally occur during the Arctic summer, many Norwegians create it themselves—with eye masks, covered window glass, blackout curtains, and the like. They know that avoiding exposure to evening light is the most important key to being able to sleep well. That’s because the part of our brain that regulates our circadian rhythms (called the suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN) is located at the intersection of our optic nerves, where light and darkness signal the processes that wake us up and make us sleepy. Without darkness, our brains aren’t signaled to produce the melatonin that makes us sleepy and keeps us asleep. By simulating darkness, we can prompt these natural processes and encourage better sleep.
</p>

<p>
<h2>2. Keep to a consistent sleep schedule</h2>
</p>
<p>
Many Norwegians also make an effort to stay on a consistent sleep schedule despite the constant light during the summer months—especially waking up at, or close to, the same time everyday. When we are forced into a schedule, as anyone with children knows, it's easier to ensure we are getting enough sleep. Waking up at a consistent, relatively early time each morning is especially important, as it will naturally discourage you from staying up too late. As people in Arctic Norway can attest, just because you can go hiking at 1 AM doesn’t necessarily mean you should!
</p>
<p>
<h2>3. Ban gadgets from the bedroom</h2>
</p>
<p>
Smart phones, laptops, tablets, and TV all emit blue light, which is precisely the kind of light that is most disruptive to our circadian rhythms at night. Since avoiding exposure to evening light (and especially blue light) is the single most important thing we can do to promote better sleep, banning these devices from the bedroom, or at least shutting them off at a scheduled time a couple of hours before bed, can go a long way towards ensuring that we get the restful sleep that’s so essential to health.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4. Exercise and eat well</h2>
</p>
<p>
Getting regular exercise and eating a healthy diet can also help sleep cycles. Exercising as early in the day as possible can make it easier to unwind in the evening. Minimizing caffeine and sugar intake, especially within several hours of bedtime, can help too. Also try to avoid alcohol; while it may help you fall asleep initially, it can cause you to wake during the night and make it difficult to fall back asleep. Taking supplements (including fish oil) is a good idea, since our bodies require adequate levels of many nutrients in order to produce the melatonin, other hormones, and neurotransmitters that regulate our circadian rhythms. Taking your supplements early in the day can help make sure they don’t disrupt your sleep at night.
</p>
<p>
<h2>5. Relax</h2>
</p>
<p>
When we’re having a hard time sleeping, it often causes us to worry and spend a lot of time thinking about it, which then increases our stress and makes it even harder to sleep, leading to a seemingly never-ending cycle that can be hard to break. But,  while stress may be inevitable, how we deal with it does not have to be. Work towards learning to deal with stress in more healthy ways to unwind and get a good night’s sleep.
</p>
<p>
Adapting to the circumstances of life near the Arctic circle is nothing unusual in Norway. Whether they face endless daylight in summer, or endless darkness in winter, people living at high latitudes embrace these extremes as opportunities to thrive. We can all learn something from their approach, adapting to the stressors and extremes of our own lives in ways that don’t keep us up at night, no matter where we live.

  No one likes a trip to the doctor—the sniffly, germy waiting rooms, nurses with clipboards, those emasculating gowns. Men especially hate going. Kinda like how your dog hates going to the vet. Here’s my strategy: I try really hard not to go.
</p>
<p>
  If you also dislike doctor’s visits, you’ve got good reason to start taking omega-3s (a.k.a. essential fatty acids). Rarely do you find a nutrient as broadly beneficial as omega-3s.* Why? Because these essential fats make up the 60-100 trillion cell membranes found throughout your body, from toes to nose. Plus they’ve been shown by countless studies (actually, 8000+ clinical studies) to help maintain many aspects of health, from immune and metabolic health, to cognitive, joint, and even eye health.* But for men, especially, the big one is the heart.

</p>
<p>
  As most people know, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Americans, but men face this health risk earlier in life than women do. According to <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-attack-and-stroke-men-vs-women" target="_none">Harvard Medical School</a>, men are, on average, seven years younger than women when they suffer their first heart attack.  Which means there’s less time for men to put off heart-healthy lifestyle changes. The time to act is now.
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Health Food for Your Heart</h2>
</p>
<p>
  Eat well and exercise, right? You’ve heard it before. We all need to be more active and cut way down on the nachos and fried foods—that’s a given. But one valuable, easy-to-follow suggestion on the diet-side is to consume more heart-healthy omega-3 fats.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s a little trade secret to convince you: The FDA is pretty strict about what omega-3 brands can claim about their products. Supplements are not drugs, they tell us. They’re not cures for disease. They’re nutrients—food, essentially. But the one area where the FDA gives us more room to talk about our fish oils is in relation to heart disease. That’s because there’s so much evidence that omega-3s can benefit the heart that it would be a detriment to public health to keep people in the dark.
</p>
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788655/web/blog-assets/post-images/salmon.jpg">
<p>


  <a href="http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/23/2/151" target="_none">The American Heart Association agrees</a>. They recommend 1,000 mg of omega-3 EPA+DHA per day for people with documented coronary heart disease. For folks with high triglycerides they recommend far more: 2,000–4,000 mg per day. What percentage of people do you think actually follow these recommendations? I have no idea either, but given that <a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf" target="_none">90% of Americans are deficient in omega-3s</a>, it’s probably pretty small.

</p>
<p>
  <h2>Easy Insurance</h2>
</p>
<p>
  The upshot is this: If men hope to avoid those silly hospital gowns, a good first step is to stay healthy by consuming a lot more omega-3s. We should all eat wild-caught, oily fish like salmon, sardines, cod, mackerel, and anchovies each week. But really, how many of us do this with any regularity? Omega-3s must be constantly replenished because they are always used by cell membranes. For this reason, it’s important to supplement daily with high-quality fish oil to fill in any nutritional gaps and to make sure you’re getting a steady source of omega-3 fats.
</p>
<p>
  There’s no way to completely avoid trips to the doctor, but a daily serving of fish oil is a pretty easy insurance policy.

Our new <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1775" target="_none">Vitamin D3+K2 Gummies</a> for adults combines two essential nutrients for supporting bone health in a single, tasty gummy.* But while almost everyone has heard of vitamin D3, not many people know about the bone-building and cardiovascular benefits of vitamin K2. So we thought we would break it down as best we could.
</p>
<p>
<h2>From doorman to foreman</h2>
</p>
<p>
Vitamin D3, among other important functions, helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorous—vital bone-building minerals—from the foods you eat. It “pulls” calcium and phosphorous from your gut and your kidneys into your bloodstream, where it can be ushered to other parts of the body (namely, your bones). Think of vitamin D3 as the doorman for your body’s calcium intake.
</p>
<p>
Vitamin K2, also known as menaquinone-7, helps direct the calcium in your blood away from your arteries (where it can hang out and cause problems) to your bones, where it’s needed for the never-ending work that is constructing new bone tissue. Think of vitamin K2 as the foreman for your body’s building site.
</p>
<p>
It’s how these two nutrients work together that’s so compelling. The doorman lets the calcium in, and the foreman puts it to good use building bones. And, in directing calcium away from your arteries where it can accumulate and contribute to plaque, vitamin K2 can actually support heart health in addition to bone health.*
</p>
<p>
Something you might not know about your bones—they’re constantly being rebuilt over time. This process is called remodeling, and it occurs in response to mechanical and hormonal signals. During childhood, bone metabolism is at peak production; but by the time you hit your early twenties, your bones are no longer actually growing. They are, however, constantly changing. And that’s because bone itself is dynamic, living tissue.
</p>
<p>
<h2>About your bones</h2>
</p>
<p>
The skeletal system, made up of 206 bones, is literally the foundation of health. Made mostly of collagen and calcium phosphate, bones hold and protect your organs, and serve as attachment points for muscles. Your bones also produce red and white blood cells and act as a reservoir for important minerals.
</p>
<div class="embedded-image left" style="width: 68%">
<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788654/web/blog-assets/post-images/bone-graphic.png">
<span style="padding-left: 28px; padding-right: 28px; display: inline-block">In a healthy body, osteoclasts and osteoblasts work together to maintain the balance between bone loss and bone formation.</span>
</div>
<p>
Bone cells called osteoblasts are responsible for building bones—they secrete the collagen that is needed to form the matrix, or structural frame, for building new bone. Conversely, osteoclasts are bone cells that are responsible for breaking down old or injured bone; they secrete an enzyme that dissolves the collagen matrix that osteoblasts create. The idea is that this constant process of remodeling results in a completely new skeleton for you every 7 to 10 years.
</p>
<p>
The catch is, as we get older our bodies produce fewer osteoblasts—which means we have fewer cells to build new bone. By age 40, we’ve already started <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00127" target="_none">losing bone mass</a>. This is why fractures may take longer to heal, and why we’re more prone to fractures in the first place. It’s also why eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise (<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/bonehealth/conditioninfo/Pages/activity.aspx" target="_none">weight-bearing exercise causes new bone to form</a>) become particularly important lifestyle choices as we age.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Putting calcium to good use</h2>
</p>
<p>
Your body needs calcium to build bone, and vitamin D3 helps your body absorb calcium. So even if you’re getting enough calcium in your diet, it might be going to waste if you’re not also getting enough vitamin D. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends that adults over the age of 50 get at least 1,000 mg calcium daily, and 1000 IU vitamin D daily.
</p>
<p>
Phosphorous, magnesium, and vitamins A, C, and K are also important nutrients for bone health. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11684396" target="_none">Vitamin K</a>, best known for its role in helping blood to clot, has been gaining more attention in the scientific community for its role in binding newly absorbed calcium to the mineral matrix in bone—as well as directing calcium away from our arteries and soft tissues, where it definitely isn’t wanted.
</p>
<p>

  <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788654/web/blog-assets/post-images/calcium-deposits.jpg">
</p>
<p>


These <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/calcium-beyond-the-bones" target="_none">unwanted calcium deposits</a> (shown microscopically in the above image) can damage our hearts by contributing to plaque in the walls of our arteries. This plaque, made up of fat, cholesterol, and calcium, can harden over time and eventually restrict blood flow. Not a healthy scenario by any measure. Best to help this wayward calcium find it’s way out of your bloodstream, and into your bones where it belongs.
</p>
<p>
And that’s where our new <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1775" target="_none">Vitamin D3+K2</a> Gummies come in handy. Let’s face it, this dynamic, bone-building, plaque-fighting  vitamin duo is pretty easy to love.

        <p><i>If you buy Nordic Naturals products from one of our overseas distributors, you might have indirectly crossed paths with our very own Derek Bodkin. Read our interview with Derek here, and <a href="#vid">watch him whistling on stage at the 2016 Redwood Ramble music festival</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Name:</b> Derek Bodkin</p>
<p><b>Role:</b> International Sales Account Coordinator</p>
<p><b>Years with Nordic Naturals:</b> 5.5</p>

<p>
<b>What do you do at Nordic Naturals, and what do you like best about your job?</b>
I work with our distributors to get Nordic Naturals products overseas. This is not my first role at Nordic Naturals, and it’s really a different mindset from what I was doing before. What I like about it is seeing how things operate on a global scale, and also seeing things from a different cultural perspective. It’s a job that has strengthened my desire to see more of the world.
</p>
<p>
<b>Where did you grow up, and how has that place influenced you?</b>
I was born in Boston, but I grew up mostly in southern California. Being a musician and living in close proximity to L.A., I eventually found myself in Hollywood, doing post-production sound editing and music editing. I also did some work as a voice-over actor. But I wasn’t really playing music, which has always been my passion. It was when I moved to Santa Cruz that I started playing dive bars and then that evolved into bigger shows that grew into touring on my days off.
</p>
<p>
<b>What personal accomplishment are you most proud of?</b>
Recording and producing an entire album. I played most of the instruments myself, wrote most of the songs, and paid my other musicians for their time and their talents. Other friends offered to help me with it here and there, but it was really important to me to do it on my own. The album is called <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/derekbodkin" target="_none">“True Story.”</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is something about you that few people know? Do you have any hidden talents?</b>
Most people here know that I’m a musician, and that I’m in a band and I have this whole other life outside of work.  But not a lot of people know that I’m a <a href="#vid">professional whistler</a> (laughs).  And that I’m a multi-instrumentalist.  I have a degree in music composition and conducting, with my major instrument being percussion. I’ve played banjo, guitar, harmonica, and piano since I was a child.
</p>
<p>
<b>What Nordic Naturals products do you take? Any observations you’d like to share?</b>
I’ve never been a supplements guy, mostly because I can never remember to take them. But I always remember to take my <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1428" target="_none">Ultimate Omega</a>, everyday. I think it keeps me from feeling dried out on the inside. I also take <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Vitamin_D3_formulas/365" target="_none">vitamin D</a> on my doctor’s orders.
</p>
<p>
<b>What does “living healthfully” mean to you?</b>
Finding balance. It’s hard not to take work home with you, but if you can do that, great. I also think it’s important to govern yourself with integrity. Stay away from gossip. Be honest, even when it’s uncomfortable.

          <p>Few things can be more frustrating than getting a child to eat what we parents consider healthy foods. My biggest “mommy fail” moments seem to revolve around the dinner table when I see my 3-year-old refuse to eat anything that doesn’t involve pasta, bread, or rice.</p><p>Yet as our pediatrician often reminds me, it’s actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3474391/" target="_none">developmentally appropriate for preschoolers to refuse foods</a> we give them. And it’s wise to look at what kids eat over the course of a week rather than a single day before worrying about their eating habits.</p><p>That said, the food struggles at our house motivated me to come up with a few good tricks for tempting my picky eater to try new foods every now and then. Here’s what has (mostly) worked for me:</p><p><h2>1. Have your child help you cook.</h2> Stirring, measuring, cracking eggs, sprinkling spices—kids are curious creatures, and are often happy to get involved in meal prep. I’ve found that my preschooler is a whole lot more willing to eat something if he feels he’s had a hand in making it.</p><p><h2>2. Start the meal with a healthy snack.</h2> As a first course, I often give my child a whole baby carrot (I buy them with the tops still on so they look more interesting). I peel it and hand it to him while he’s waiting for me to prep the rest of his meal. Nine times out of ten, he eats it. He’s also been known to nosh on green (pitted) olives and cucumber wedges pre-dinnertime.</p><p><h2>3. Disguise your protein.</h2> Surprisingly, my child turns his nose up at popular kid favorites like meatballs and chicken strips. But I’ve mixed canned salmon in with mac ‘n cheese with some success. And I’ve learned to love Sloppy Joes (my son loves the soft texture), because it’s a good way to get him to eat grass-fed beef, along with some hidden grated zucchini.</p><p><h2>3. Offer rejects regularly.</h2> Apparently, kids need to be exposed to new foods repeatedly before they will decide to like them. Some experts say it takes 10 – 15 “tastes” before a kid will accept a new food into his repertoire. The key seems to be not to react if the food you serve gets rejected. Still working on this one…</p><div class="embedded-image left" style="width: 70%;"><img src="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/dev/blog-assets/post-images/little-ones-content-image.jpg" ></div><p><h2>5. Get creative with it.</h2> Kids love food that’s fun to eat. Whether it’s arranging food in colorful rainbows, or dressing up veggies to look like faces, your creative efforts might just pay off. Also, many moms have had success serving proteins and vegetables with healthy dips like hummus, pesto, or marinara sauce. This hasn’t yet worked at my house (unless you count ketchup as a healthy dip), but it hasn’t deterred me from trying.</p><p><h2>6. Use peer pressure.</h2> It’s true, kids are more likely to eat foods they see other kids eating and enjoying. If you know a mom whose kid loves a wide range of foods, invite that family over to dinner. Chances are your child will pay close attention to what the other kids are eating.</p><p><h2>7. Grow with them.</h2> Even if you don’t have a yard, you can grow cherry tomatoes, lettuces, and other edibles in a pot. Seeing food grow can help kids make the connection between the food we buy in the grocery store, and where that food actually comes from. And hopefully, seeing some of Mother Nature’s magic will be captivating enough to tempt your child to try a few new veggies.</p><p><h2>8. Make supplements part of your daily routine.</h2> You might be rolling your eyes at this point (here comes the pitch!) at this point. But honestly, I feel much better giving my kid a <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/98/?ProdID=1411" target="_none">good daily multivitamin</a> and a dose of <a href="http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Children's_Omegas/473" target="_none">children’s omega-3s</a> in the morning to fill in the nutritional gaps. We also on occasion add a <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Children's_Gummies/475" target="_none">vitamin D or vitamin C gummy</a>, depending on the time of year and whether or not I think he may be coming down with a cold, and a <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1747" target="_none">kid’s probiotic</a>. It’s easy to give him these as he’s eating breakfast, and now he actually asks for his vitamins every morning. A good lifelong habit in the making, I say.</p>

          <p><i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine recently published an article advising their readers which vitamins and supplements they should keep taking, and which ones they could probably skip.</p><div class=\"embedded-image right\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501789691/web/blog-assets/post-images/cosmo-cover-terra-post2.jpg\" ></div><p>While we were thrilled to see <i>Cosmo</i> raising awareness about the importance of nutritional supplements, we were disheartened to see that omega-3s and fish oil made their “definitely stop taking” list. We of course wanted to respond, and contribute some useful information about fish oil and its well-established safety and health benefits.</p><p>Here’s our response to each of the points the <i>Cosmo</i> <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a8349732/do-you-really-need-to-take-vitamins/\" target="_none">article</a> makes:</p><p><h2>1. Omega-3 fish oil supplements “act as potentially dangerous blood thinners.”</h2></p><p>First, it’s important to note that omega-3 fish oil will not prevent your blood from coagulating. Omega-3 fish oil has been shown to help inhibit blood platelet clumping, blood vessel constriction, and the production of blood-clotting proteins—all of which can be understood as blood-thinning actions. On the other hand, when we consider that a diet rich in processed foods promotes exactly the opposite effects—i.e., increased blood platelet clumping, constriction of blood vessels, and blood-clotting proteins—we can see that the actions of omega-3 fish oil are more accurately understood as restoring a healthy balance between blood-thinning and blood-clotting.</p><p>So does this make fish oil supplements potentially dangerous? The answer is no. For the overwhelming majority of people, the blood-thinning actions of omega-3 fish oil should be seen as potentially beneficial rather than potentially dangerous. If you currently take blood-thinning medications or if you anticipate surgery, we recommend consulting with your healthcare provider before taking any supplement.</p><p><h2>2. Most omega-3 fish oil supplements “are high in vitamins A and D that you can’t eliminate easily, so they could build up and make you sick.”</h2></p><p>Are omega-3 fish oil supplements high in vitamins A and D? The answer depends on what type of omega-3 fish oil you are talking about: Fish oil is extracted from the whole body of the fish and contains only trace amounts of vitamins A and D, which are generally lost during the purification process. For this reason, some manufacturers will add vitamins A and D to their fish oil products. So it’s always important to read supplement labels. Arctic cod liver oil, which is extracted from the livers of fish, does contain small amounts of naturally occurring vitamins A and D, even after purification.</p><p>We’ve always used only 100% Arctic cod livers in our cod liver oil products. Our <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Arctic_Cod_Liver_Oil/378">Arctic Cod Liver Oils</a> have low, healthy levels of fat-soluble vitamin A typically averaging 650–1,500 IU of vitamin A per serving, which falls in the low range compared to other products. (<a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/1" target="_none">The recommended daily allowance of vitamin A for adults</a> as established by the US Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science is 3,000 IU for men and 2,300 IU for women.)</p><p>When it comes to vitamin D, neither fish oil nor cod liver oil supplements naturally contain high levels. The real concern with vitamin D is getting enough. There’s an emerging consensus among the medical and scientific community that <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/#vitamin-d-deficiency-a-global-concern" target="_none">vitamin D deficiency</a> is an under-recognized epidemic. (It’s why we offer many of our <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Vitamin_D3_formulas/365" target="none">products</a> with the option of added vitamin D.)</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recently <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-On-the-Double.aspx" target="_none">doubled its vitamin D recommendations</a> for infants, children, and adolescents, and a whole new generation of vitamin D research continues to show just how critical vitamin D is to every aspect of health. We use vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in our products because it’s the most easily absorbed form of vitamin D, and the form our bodies naturally make from sunlight.</p><p><h2>3. “Eat fish and use olive oil instead” of taking omega-3 fish oil supplements.</h2></p><p>While we wholeheartedly support <i>Cosmo’s</i> advice to get our nutrients from fresh foods instead of supplements whenever possible, we also recognize that often it simply isn’t possible to consume enough of the health-promoting nutrients we need from food alone. Omega-3s are a good example. To get 1,000 mg of the beneficial omega-3s EPA and DHA found in fish oil, you’d have to eat 2/3 of a can of sardines—every day! We don’t know about you, but two soft gels a day of our concentrated <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1428" target="_none">Ultimate Omega</a><sup>®</sup> omega-3 fish oil sure does seem a lot easier to swallow.</p>

          <p>Ocean \"smog\" created from the disposable plastics we all throw away has become a huge concern. Right now, there are some 270,000 tons of trash swirling around the world's oceans in giant, tangled heaps. Ocean waves break these plastics down into smaller and smaller pieces, endangering the surrounding marine life as fish and birds either digest the plastic debris, mistaking it for food, or become entangled in it. Some of the plastic toxins they digest even make it up the food chain into the fish many of us eat. That’s right—we’re eating the plastic trash, too. One study found that <a href=\"http://www.ecowatch.com/25-of-fish-sold-at-markets-contain-plastic-or-man-made-debris-1882105614.html\" target=\"_none\">one-quarter of all fish sold in California markets had microplastics and fibers in their guts</a>. </p><p> Cleaning up the trash with some sort of floating, supersized garbage truck may sound like an obvious fix, but these vast islands of plastic trash—water bottles, straws, caps, food wrappers, bags, chunks of old, unrecognizable gadgets and toys—can’t just be collected and taken away. The disintegrating plastics permeate our oceans just like smog permeates our air. We can’t really filter it out. We have to stop the ocean smog at its source—us.</p><p>Here are 10 things we can all do today to help clean up our oceans—courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.5gyres.org\" target=\"_none\">The 5 Gyres Institute</a>, a non-profit dedicated to empowering all of us to take action in response to this unhealthy scenario. We at Nordic Naturals are inspired, and proud to sponsor and support <a href=\"https://www.5gyres.org/\" target=\"_none\">5 Gyres</a> in spreading the word.</p><h5>How Can We Help?</h5><p><h2>1.</h2> Swear off plastic bags. Stash some reusable bags in your car, or carry a backpack or tote bag with you.</p><p><h2>2.</h2> Carry a reusable water bottle. Don’t buy bottled water—<a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/clean-water/save-1400-a-year-by-drinking-tap-water.html\" target=\"_none\">you can save $1400 a year by just drinking tap.</a></p><p><h2>3.</h2> Say no to straws, or only use paper straws. When you order a drink, say “No straw, please.”</p><p><h2>4.</h2> Use non-plastic utensils and bring your own mug to the coffee shop. Get in the habit of carrying these with you when you’re out and about.</p><p><h2>5.</h2> <a href=\"https://www.5gyres.org/styrofoam/\" target=\"_none\">Avoid all things Styrofoam.</a> The chemicals used to create Styrofoam cups and food containers are toxic and possibly carcinogenic. Bad for you, bad for the oceans.</p><p><h2>6.</h2> Buy items with minimal packaging, and buy in bulk whenever possible. Choose non-plastic beverage containers.</p><p><h2>7.</h2> Minimize your electronic footprint by repairing, upgrading, or recycling old phones, TVs, computers, and peripherals.</p><div class=\"embedded-image left\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788652/web/blog-assets/post-images/5Gyres3.jpg\"/><span style=\"padding-left: 28px; padding-right: 28px; display: inline-block\">Photo by Ryan Martin for 5 Gyres</span></div><p><h2>8.</h2> Buy clothes made from natural materials. Synthetic clothing items shed microfibers every time they’re washed, and these fibers wind up in the ocean.</p><p><h2>9.</h2> Don’t buy face cleansers and scrubs that contain microbeads (they’ll be phased out soon anyway, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm531849.htm\" target=\"_none\">Microbead-Free Waters Act</a>).</p><p><h2>10.</h2> Pledge to go <a href=\"https://www.5gyres.org/newsletter-sign-up\" target=\"_none\">#plasticfree</a> for a day, a week, a year—or forever. Start by refusing the top five sources of single use plastic: plastic bags, water bottles, to-go containers, takeaway cups, and straws.</p><p>Cleaning up our oceans isn’t going to happen overnight. But we can all make a difference—one piece of plastic trash at a time.</p>

        content: `
          <p>“Triglycerides” are something we talk about a lot at Nordic Naturals. They sound intimidating, but all you really need to know is that they’re the form of omega-3 fats that your body prefers. And, many fish oils on the market today are not triglyceride form. Let me explain.</p><p>Triglycerides are a form of molecule. You may hear that “high triglycerides” are bad for the heart, but I’m talking about a different kind that is really important for overall health. That’s because dietary fats are really important for us, and 98% of all fats we eat are triglycerides. None of this would matter beyond the lab if all companies produced fish oil the right way—as natural omega-3s. Sadly, they don’t. But if you know to look for triglyceride form omega-3s—the natural form—it’s easy to find great fish oil.</p><p>Natural-form fish oil is better for a handful of reasons. Freshness, effectiveness, and value topthe list. You’d expect this since triglyceride-form fats abound in nature. But what about the alternative?</p><p><h2>Natural Form = Fresh</h2></p><p>Most fish oils are made of ethyl ester molecules, which are the result of concentrating omega-3s to make a more potent product, and then skipping a final step that recreates the natural molecular form. No big surprise, skipping this step is cheaper for fish oil manufacturers, but the cost-savings don’t translate to you. Ethyl ester fish oils are fragile, so the molecules have a hard time holding together, and are more susceptible to damage by oxygen. That means a lot of spoiled, stinky fish oil—and more free radicals.</p><p><h2>Natural Form = Effective</h2></p><div class=\"embedded-image right\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/nordic-naturals/image/upload/v1501788657/web/blog-assets/post-images/tg-form-graph-compressor.jpg\" ></div><p>Natural-form fish oil is also more effective than ethyl ester fish oil. A number of studies have documented the body’s improved ability to absorb and use natural form omega-3s. Up to 70% better absorption than ethyl esters.<sup>1</sup> This means that the more natural form omega-3s there are in your bottle of fish oil, the greater chance they have to make it where they should—your cells.</p><p>The cell membrane is where omega-3s really have the chance to make a difference, influencing heart health, vision, brain development, and the wide-ranging functions of the immune system that benefit so many aspects of everyday health. Of course, poorly absorbed fish oil means fewer omega-3s in the bloodstream, fewer getting to cells, and limited benefits overall. You get the idea.</p><p><h2>Natural Form = Value</h2></p><p>All this adds up to one big advantage: value. Why spend money on fish oil that spoils quickly, and that doesn’t deliver the benefits you expect? The big picture sometimes gets lost when customers choose products solely on lowest price.</p><p>I’m happy to tell you that Nordic Naturals has always had the big picture in mind. From the very beginning we’ve produced our fish oils in their natural form. Every bottle contains at least 90% natural-form omega-3s, and they often reach up to 98%. It takes longer to make triglyceride-form products. And, it costs more. But at the end of the day, it’s the value of our products that matters most.</p><p><small><sup>1</sup><i>Dyerberg J, et al. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20638827\" target=\"_none\">Bioavailability of marine n-3 fatty acid formulations.

          <p><i>If you happen to call Nordic Naturals to place an order or ask a product question, there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself chatting with the unforgettable Jonna Paiss. We asked Jonna to be the subject of our first employee spotlight, and she graciously accepted. Read our interview with Jonna here, and <a href=\"#embed-container\">watch her answer our parting question on video</a>.</i></p><p><b>Name:</b> <p>Jonna Paiss</p><b>Role:</b> <p>Consumer Sales and Education Representative</p><b>Years with Nordic Naturals:</b> <p>5</p><p><b>What do you do at Nordic Naturals, and what do you like best about your job?</b></p><p>I work in customer service, so I answer questions about our products all day long. I’ve always been interested in nutrition and biology, and I like helping people find the right supplement for them. I used to work in the healthcare industry, and for me working in the natural products industry is much more satisfying.</p><p>One reason I like talking about our products is because I have so much confidence in them. I try everything we make so I can get a firsthand experience with each product. I keep a spice rack in my bathroom filled with all my Nordic Naturals supplements.</p><p><b>What’s the strangest customer question you’ve ever received?</b></p><p>I certainly get some very specific questions from customers, everything from whether or not our products are kosher to what kinds of glue we use on our product labels. It’s part of the fun, you know, going and hunting down the answers to the more unusual questions.</p><p>I guess the strangest question I ever got was from a woman who called to ask about the tiny illustrated trolls on our Nordic Berries multivitamin label. She wanted to know if they were associated with the occult. I told her the trolls were common in Norwegian fairy tales, nothing more than a fanciful reference to Scandinavian folklore.</p><p><b>Where did you grow up?</b></p><p>I was born and raised in a small town in Denmark, and I immigrated to the US when I was in my twenties. I practically grew up in a library... I spent most of my teenage years with my head in a book, and I’m still a voracious reader today.</p><p><b>Since you’ve been here for 5 years, I gather you’ve been taking fish oil for a while. Any observations you’d like to share?</b></p><p>Probably the biggest thing I noticed when I first started working here was the high product quality. I’ve always trusted the science behind the nutrition, so I never questioned things I experienced in the past with other products, like fishy aftertaste or unpleasant burps. I just figured those things were to be tolerated, the way you tolerate other things that might be good for you—like onions.</p><p><b>What Nordic Naturals products do you take?</b></p><p>I currently take <a href=\"http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1746\" target=\"_none\">Omega Curcumin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1414\" target=\"_none\">EPA</a> with concentrated <a href=\"http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1647\" target=\"_none\">GLA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Vitamin_D3_formulas/365\" target=\"_none\">vitamin D3</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1699\" target=\"_none\">Nordic Flora Probiotic Daily</a>. Over the years I’ve tried a lot of different formulations, but in general I try to take 2000 milligrams EPA and DHA daily. In the winter especially, I take vitamin D3 regularly. And I supplement with other products, like Omega Curcumin and <a href=\"http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/General_Public/Eye_Health/1231\" target=\"_none\">Omega Vision</a>, depending on whatever issue I may be trying to address. When I first tried our Nordic Flora probiotics, I was like, oh my God! Because I felt an immediate difference. (laughs)</p><p><b>What is something about you that few people know? Do you have a hidden talent?</b></p><p>I have nothing BUT hidden talents. All my talents are really hard to find! One advantage of talking to new people all day is that my jokes never get old. I try to be light about things, because I enjoy making people laugh.</p><p><b>I happen to know that you’re really good at crafting.</b></p><p>Yes, I do like to sew and knit and do crafty things. I’m really into making costumes right now. And a lot of people don’t know this, but I’m actually a good cook. I developed some pretty good cooking skills in college—whisking and stirring, those are my hidden talents. And talking and enjoying good food with friends.</p><p><b>We talk a lot about health here at Nordic Naturals. What does “living healthfully” mean to you?</b></p><p>To me “living healthfully” is a state of mind. It’s about striving for harmony and balance in your life. We have a saying in Denmark: “Everything in moderation, including moderation.” I think it’s important to pick your battles in life, and focus on what gives you enjoyment. Otherwise it’s really easy to get frustrated and feel powerless. I guess you could say I try not to sweat the small stuff.<p><p><b>Video Question: You’re from Denmark. Explain “hygge” to us.</b><div id=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/212996319\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div></p>
